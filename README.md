## Project Overview  

- Dataset sourced from **Kaggle** (raw housing data).  
- Data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize features.  
- Applied **feature engineering** and **one-hot encoding** for categorical features like location.  
- Used **Ridge Regression model** for training and saved it as a pickle file.  
- Built a **Flask web application** with a simple UI to take inputs and display predicted prices.
